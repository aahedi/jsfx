# jsfx

A real time WebGL image effects library, heavily inspired by https://github.com/evanw/glfx.js. I needed something that could fallback to a canvas, and additionally, I needed the same effects to render server side.

# todo

* Need to move jsfx.Filter and jsfx.FilterInterface into the jsfx.filter namespace, but the compilation doesn't work as the single file is not ordered
* Add the rest of the filters
